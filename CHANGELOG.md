## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `x-request-id` header to RPC responses. If the request does not have the header set then an ID is generated. This can be used to identify a specific caller's request/response within the node's logs. Duplicate IDs are possible since they can be set by the caller, so we recommend making your's identifiable with a prefix or using a GUID.
- Improved tracing for RPC requests. These are all logged on `trace` level under the `pathfinder_rpc` module. Additional information can also be obtained from `tower_http` module. These can be enabled by appending `pathfinder_rpc=trace,tower_http=trace` to `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
  - Request payload is now logged before execution begins.
  - Logs now include `x-request-id` header value which can be used to correlate with client requests/responses.
  - Batch logs also include the index within a batch.

### Fixed

- v0.5 `starknet_simulateTransactions` returns internal error instead of `ContractError` for reverted transactions.
- v0.6 `starknet_getTransactionReceipt`
  - `EXECUTION_RESOURCES` fields are hex-strings instead of integers
  - `segment_arena_builtin` resource is missing
  - v3 transaction price unit type is `STRK` instead of `FRI`

### Changed

- JSON-RPC v0.6 now serves `0.6.0` for `starknet_specVersion`.

## [0.10.1] - 2023-12-05

### Fixed

- Execution errors are opaque and don't always include the root cause.
- Pathfinder uses incorrect fee token gas price for `gas_consumed` calculation for v3 transactions.
- `starknet_traceTransaction` sometimes returns an "Invalid order number for L2-to-L1 message" error.
- `starknet_getTransactionByHash` and `starknet_getTransactionByBlockIdAndIndex` return v3 transactions mapped to v1.

### Changed

- JSON-RPC v0.6 support has been updated to v0.6.0-rc5 of the specification.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-11-29

### Added

- Support for RPC v0.6.0-rc4 via the `/rpc/v0_6` endpoint. Note that this does not include the `/rpc/v0.6` endpoint as the underscore is now the standard across node implementations.
- Configuration options to selectively enable/disable parts of the node. This can be useful to run tests or benchmarks with isolated components e.g. test RPC methods without the sync process updating the database.
  - `rpc.enable` configuration option to enable/disable the RPC server. Defaults to enabled.
  - `sync.enable` configuration option to enable/disable the sync process. Defaults to enabled. 
- Support for Sepolia testnet via `--network testnet-sepolia`
- Support for Sepolia integration via `--network integration-sepolia`
- Support for Starknet 0.13.0.

### Changed

- Default RPC version is now v0.5 (was v0.4). This can be manually configured to any version.
- Goerli testnet network selection is now `--network testnet-goerli`, removed `--network testnet`
- Goerli integration network selection is now `--network integration-goerli`, removed `--network testnet`
- Reworked `newHeads` subscription output to more accurately represent header data.

### Removed

- Support for `testnet2`
- Support for RPC v0.3
- `--poll-pending` configuration option. This is now always enabled and set to 2s.
- `--python-subprocesses` configuration option. This is superseded by `--rpc.execution-concurrency`.

## [0.9.7] - 2023-11-21

### Fixed

- `get_block_hash` syscall returns `0x0` for the latest available block (current - 10) when executing `starknet_trace*` methods

## [0.9.6] - 2023-11-20

### Fixed

- RPC v0.5 incorrectly has a status field in pending `starknet_getBlockWithXXX` responses.
- Error details for many execution-related issues were not properly sent back to the JSON client and were logged on WARN level instead.

## [0.9.5] - 2023-11-09

### Added

- Host JSON-RPC on `/rpc/v0_x` in addition to the existing `/rpc/v0.x` endpoints. This applies to all supported JSON-RPC versions.

### Changed

- RPC errors now only include the root cause if white-listed as non-sensitive
- RPC v0.5 updated from v0.5.0 to v0.5.1

### Fixed

- JSON-RPC v0.5 transaction traces now have the required `type` property.
- JSON-RPC v0.5 L1 Handler receipt is missing the `message_hash` property.
- JSON-RPC v0.5 use wrong field names in ExecutionResources

## [0.9.4] - 2023-11-02

### Changed

- RPC methods now use an empty block for pending data if no viable pending data is present. Requests for pending data will no longer fail with `BlockNotFound` if there is no pending data available, but rather use an empty block on-top of the latest local block.

### Fixed

- RPC errors do not always include the root cause. For example, some gateway error messages are not output when pathfinder forwards the request.
- RPC trace object uses wrong property `reverted_reason` instead of `revert_reason`.
- RPC execution steps limits have been updated to match the setup of the Starknet sequencer.
- RPC query version bit is now correctly passed through to the blockifier.

### Added

- RPC v0.5.0 support
- Added the ability to concurrently process RPC batches, see the `rpc.batch-concurrency-limit` CLI argument.
- The `pathfinder_build_info` metric having `version` label to report current version of Pathfinder.

## [0.9.3] - 2023-10-16

### Fixed

- RPC server does not accept `charset=utf-8` in the `Content-Type` header
- Out-of-memory crash caused by rare execution queries

## [0.9.2] - 2023-10-13

### Fixed

- RPC server does not set `content-type: application/json`
- Restored the Websocket subscription features with new configuration keys: `rpc.websocket.enabled`
  `rpc.websocket.buffer-capacity`, `rpc.websocket.topic-capacity`

## [0.9.1] - 2023-10-11

### Fixed

- A storage regression causing reorgs to be slow has been fixed.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-10-10

### Fixed

- State tree updates are slow on disks with low disk IO or high latency (e.g. network attached storage).
- Pathfinder now exits with a non-zero exit status if any of the service tasks (sync/RPC/monitoring) terminates.
- Rare edge case where duplicate blocks caused the sync process to halt due to a `A PRIMARY KEY constraint failed` error.
- Querying a descync'd feeder gateway causes sync process to end due to missing classes.
- `starknet_getStorageAt` no longer returns ContractNotFound when querying for non-existent keys for contracts deployed in the pending block.
- `starknet_getNonce` no longer returns ContractNotFound when querying for nonce of contracts deployed in the pending block.

### Changed

- Reworked state tree storage schema. This is not backwards compatible and requires a re-sync.
- Switched to a custom JSON-RPC framework to more easily support multiple specification versions. This may lead to some unexpected changes in behaviour.

### Removed

- JSON-RPC subscription support (`pathfinder_newHeads`). This is temporary while we re-add support to our new JSON-RPC framework.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-09-28

### Fixed

- JSON-RPC requests containing a Cairo 0 class definition were requiring the `debug_info` property to be present in the input program. This was a regression caused by the execution engine change. 
- Performance for the `starknet_getEvents` JSON-RPC method has been improved for queries involving the pending block.

### Added

- `--sync.verify_tree_node_data` which enables verifies state tree nodes as they are loaded from disk. This is a debugging tool to identify disk corruption impacting tree node data. This should only be enabled when debugging a state root mismatch.

- RPC v0.4 methods:
  - `starknet_traceTransaction`
  - `starknet_traceBlockTransactions`
- Class cache for execution queries which provides a modest increase in performance speed.

### Changed

- `starknet_getEvents` continuation token formatting. The new format is incompatible with the previous format used v0.8.1 and older.

## [0.8.1] - 2023-09-07

### Fixed

- JSON-RPC requests with unknown parameters are rejected (unknown params were previously ignored)

### Changed

- Execution is backed by a Rust-based VM improving performance. We no longer depend on Python code in pathfinder.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-08-30

### Changed

- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.12.2
- Cairo compiler upgraded to 2.1.1
- default RPC API version changed from v0.3 to v0.4

### Fixed

- RPC v0.3 `starknet_estimateFee` example
- RPC method names could be prefixed with API version
- `starknet_getNonce` returns invalid values when queried by hash

### Added

- Added the `rpc.root-version` command-line option (and the corresponding PATHFINDER_RPC_ROOT_VERSION environment variable)
  to control the version of the JSON-RPC API pathfinder serves on the `/` path

## [0.7.2] - 2023-08-16

### Fixed

- RPC v0.4 `starknet_getTransactionByHash` uses the wrong error code for `TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND`
- Querying `starknet_getClassAt` and `starknet_getClassHashAt` by block hash incorrectly returns contract not found
- On Starknet 0.12.2 pathfinder now provides consistent pending data
- RPC v0.4 Declare v0 and Invoke v0 contain the nonce field

## [0.7.1] - 2023-08-08

### Fixed

- RPC v0.4 `starknet_getTransactionReceipt` incorrect execution and finality status names
- `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` fails to parse v0.12.1 gateway replies

### Changed

- RPC v0.4.0 support (previously supported v0.4.0-rc3)

## [0.7.0] - 2023-07-27

### Added

- RPC v0.4 support on `/rpc/v0.4/`
- control log color output via `--color auto|always|never`
- if Sierra to CASM compilation fails we now fall back to fetching CASM from the gateway
- Negate bot spam on response metrics by returning `Ok(200)` on `/` RPC queries. Web crawlers and bots often poke this endpoint which previously skewed response failure metrics when these were rejected.

### Fixed

- system contract updates are not correctly stored
- `starknet_simulateTransaction` fails for transactions sending L2->L1 messages
- deprecated error code 21 `INVALID_MESSAGE_SELECTOR` is used in RPC v0.3

### Changed

- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 12.2.1a0
- Cairo compiler upgraded from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0-rc1

### Removed

- support for RPC v0.2

## [0.6.7] - 2023-07-17

### Fixed

- some cairo 0 classes are not downloaded which can cause execution methods to fail
  - this bug was introduced in v0.6.4 and requires a resync to fix
- gateway error messages are not passed through for `add_xxx_transaction` methods
- fee estimation is under-estimating most declare transactions by factor 2
- `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` still returns `PENDING` instead of `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`

### Added

- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.12.0

## [0.6.6] - 2023-07-10

### Fixed

- stack overflow while compiling Sierra to CASM

## [0.6.5] - 2023-07-07

### Fixed

- pending data from the gateway is inconsistent
  - this could exhibit as RPC data changing status between `pending | L2 accepted | not found`, especially noticeable for transactions.

### Changed

- substantially increase the character limit of execution errors
  - previously, the RPC would return a highly truncated error message from the execution vm

## [0.6.4] - 2023-07-05

### Fixed

- Pending data is not polled for starknet v0.12 due to an HTTP error code change from the gateway.
- Transaction receipts missing `from_address` in `MSG_TO_L1`.

## [0.6.3] - 2023-06-29

### Fixed

- Sierra class hash not in declared classes sync bug

### Changed

- use all libfunc list instead of experimental for sierra compilation

## [0.6.2] - 2023-06-29

### Added

- `starknet_estimateMessageFee` for JSON-RPC v0.3.1 to estimate message fee from L1 handler.
- sync-related metrics
  - `current_block`: the currently sync'd block height of the node
  - `highest_block`: the height of the block chain
  - `block_time`: timestamp difference between the current block and its parent
  - `block_latency`: delay between current block being published and sync'd locally
  - `block_download`: time taken to download current block's data excluding classes

- configuration for new block polling interval: `--sync.poll-interval <seconds>`
- Starknet v0.12.0 support
  - sierra v2.0.0 support
  - `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.12.0a0

### Fixed

- reorgs fail if a class declaration is included in the reorg
- sync can fail if db connection pool is held saturated by rpc queries
- uses `finalized` (reorg-safe) L1 state instead of `latest`
- `starknet_getEvents` times out for queries involving a large block range

### Changed

- dropped upgrade support for pathfinder v0.4 and earlier
- separate db connection pools rpc, sync and storage
- increased the number of rpc db connections

## [0.6.1] - 2023-06-18

### Fixed

- class hash mismatch for cairo 0 classes with non-ascii text

## [0.6.0] - 2023-06-14

### Fixed

- `starknet_simulateTransaction` requires `transactions` instead of `transaction` as input field.
- gateway's error message is hidden when submitting a failed transaction
- `starknet_getEvents` is very slow for certain filter combinations

### Changed

- default RPC API version changed from v0.2 to v0.3

## [0.5.5] - 2023-05-18

### Added

- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.11.1.1

### Fixed

- RPC emits connection logs and warnings
- Fee estimate mismatch between gateway and pathfinder
  - Gateway uses a new gas price sampling algorithm which was incompatible with pathfinders.
- Fee estimate returns error when submitting Cairo 1.0.0-rc0 classes.
- Historic L1 handler transactions are served as Invoke V0
  - Older databases contain L1 handler transactions from before L1 handler was a specific transaction type. These were
    stored as Invoke V0. These are now correctly identified as being L1 Handler transactions.

### Fixed

- RPC emits connection logs and warnings

## [0.5.4] - 2023-05-09

### Added

- Starknet v0.11.1 support
  - Sierra compiler v1.0.0.rc0 (while keeping previous compiler for older contracts)
  - new block hash calculation
  - new L1 contract
- CORS support for the RPC server, enabled via the `rpc.cors-domains` command line argument
- transaction hash verification, excluding older L1 handler transactions, i.e. in blocks older than
  - 4400 for mainnet
  - 306008 for testnet

### Fixed

- rpc server panic for unprefixed unregistered method names
- remove a small time window where data which is transitioning from pending to latest block was not available for RPC queries.
  - this was commonly seen when rapidly monitoring a new transaction, which would go from `PENDING` to `TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND` to `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`.

## [0.5.3] - 2023-04-12

### Added

- `max-rpc-connections` command-line argument
- `cairo-lang` upgraded to 0.11.0.2

### Fixed

- `starknet_simulateTransaction` data model inconsistency
- `poll-pending` default value restored to `false`
- handling of invalid JSON-RPC requests

### Removed

- support for `BROADCASTED` transactions version 0

## [0.5.2] - 2023-03-28

### Added

- support `starknet_estimateFee` in the JSON-RPC v0.3 API
  - supports estimating multiple transactions
  - this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway)
- support `starknet_simulateTransaction` for JSON-RPC v0.3
  - supports simulating multiple transactions
  - this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway)
- support `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` which is exposed on all RPC routes
  - this enables querying a transactions current status, including whether the gateway has received or rejected it

### Fixed

- RPC returns int for entrypoint offsets instead of hex
- RPC rejects Fee values with more than 32 digits
- RPC does not expose `pathfinder_getProof` on v0.3 route

## [0.5.1] - 2023-03-23

### Fixed

- pathfinder can spam nethermind L1 nodes
- pathfinder stops syncing testnet2 at block 95220 due to a Sierra class compilation issue

## [0.5.0] - 2023-03-20

### Added

- support for state commitment and class commitment in pathfinder_getProof
- support for starknet v0.11
- partial support for RPC specification v0.3
  - exposed on `/rpc/v0.3/` route
  - missing support for `starknet_estimateFee` and `starknet_simulate`

### Changed

- `starknet_call` and `starknet_estimateFee` JSON-RPC methods return more detailed error messages
- `python` version requirement has changed to `3.9` or `3.10` (was `3.8` or `3.9`)

### Fixed

- RPC accepts hex inputs for Felt without '0x' prefix. This led to confusion especially when passing in a decimal string which would get silently interpreted as hex.
- using a Nethermind Ethereum endpoint occasionally causes errors such as `<block-number> could not be found` to be logged.
- sync can miss new block events by getting stuck waiting for pending data.

### Removed

- `--config` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--integration` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--sequencer-url` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `--testnet2` configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1))
- `starknet_addDeployTransaction` as this is no longer an allowed transaction
- RPC api version `0.1`, which used to be served on path `/rpc/v0.1`

## [0.4.5] - 2022-12-21

### Added

- added Newton FAQ links to readme (thanks @SecurityQQ)

### Fixed

- node fails to sync really old blocks

## [0.4.4] - 2022-12-20

### Added

- storage proofs via pathfinder_getProof by @pscott

### Changed

- improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by caching classes
- improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by using Rust for hashing

### Fixed

- starknet_getEvents returns all events when from_block="latest"
- v0.1 starknet_getStateUpdate does not contain nonces

## [0.4.3] - 2022-12-7

### Changed

- updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3

### Fixed

- testnet2 and integration flags are ignored
- starknet_estimateFee uses wrong chain ID for testnet2

## [0.4.2] - 2022-12-2

### Added

- document that --chain-id expects text as input

### Fixed

- testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swopped (bug introduced in v0.4.1)
- proxy network setups can't sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1)
- ABI serialization for starknet_estimateFee for declare transactions

## [0.4.1] - 2022-11-30

### Added

- custom Starknet support (see above for details)
- pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at <rpc-url>/rpc/pathfinder/v0.1. Currently this only contains pathfinder_version which returns the pathfinder version of the node.

### Changed

- The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: --testnet2, --integration, --config, --sequencer-url
- Optimised starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address

### Fixed

- block timestamps for pending in starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-11-30

### Added

- support for Starknet v0.10.2

### Changed

- default RPC API version changed from v0.1 to v0.2
