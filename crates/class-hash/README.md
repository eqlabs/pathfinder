This crate provides functionality to compute class hashes for both Cairo 0.x and Sierra (Cairo 1.x+) contracts in the Starknet ecosystem. It implements the official Starknet class hash computation algorithm, handling special cases for different Cairo versions and maintaining compatibility with the network's expectations.
