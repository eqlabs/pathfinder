/// This function does nothing in production builds.
///
/// ## Integration testing
/// Exits the process with error code of value `1` if the current height
/// matches. This function is only active in debug builds when both the
/// "p2p" and "integration-testing" features are enabled. A marker file is
/// created in the data directory to indicate that the failure has been
/// triggered. If the file already exists, it is removed instead. This allows
/// for easy detection of whether the failure has been triggered or not.
/// The file is named `fail_on_{prefix}_{height}`.
///
/// ## Panics
/// The function will panic if it fails to create the marker file or fails to
/// remove it when the file exists.
