//! This task:
//! 1. handles events from the P2P network, for example a vote or a proposal has
//!    been received
//! 2. handles requests from the consensus task, for example to gossip a
//!    proposal or a vote
//! 3. issues commands to the consensus engine, for example to process a
//!    proposal or a vote received from the P2P network
//! 4. caches proposals that we created and are waiting to be gossiped when the
//!    consensus task requests so
//! 5. caches proposals that we received from other validators and may need to
//!    be proposed by us in another round at the same height
