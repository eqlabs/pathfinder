///
/// Handling of delayed removal of trie data is more complicated: we have to
/// account for removed trie nodes separately.
///
/// In general, removing the trie nodes deleted at block N is only safe if we
/// don't ever need to access trie state at block < N. This is not necessarily
/// the case during a reorg: if our reorg/revert target is still in the range of
/// blocks we're keeping trie history for then removing deleted nodes for the
/// reorged-away blocks would break the trie for the blocks _before_
/// the reorg target. Instead, we move all the removed nodes in the reorged-away
/// range to be "owned" by the revert target block.
///
/// For trie roots: if there was a root change in the interval we're reverting
/// that will be taken care by the revert anyway (we're changing the trie during
/// the reverse state update, so there will be a new root inserted). If there
/// were no changes then there was no root index inserted in the revert range so
/// we remove nothing when purging the blocks after the revert.
