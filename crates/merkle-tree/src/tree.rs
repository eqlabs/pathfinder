//! Starknet utilises a custom Binary Merkle-Patricia Tree to store and organise
//! its state.
//!
//! From an external perspective the tree is similar to a key-value store, where
//! both key and value are [Felts](Felt). The difference is that each tree is
//! immutable, and any mutations result in a new tree with a new root. This
//! mutated variant can then be accessed via the new root, and the old variant
//! via the old root.
//!
//! Trees share common nodes to be efficient. These nodes perform reference
//! counting and will get deleted once all references are gone. State can
//! therefore be tracked over time by mutating the current state, and storing
//! the new root. Old states can be dropped by deleting old roots which are no
//! longer required.
//!
//! #### Tree definition
//!
//! It is important to understand that since all keys are [Felts](Felt), this
//! means all paths to a key are equally long - 251 bits.
//!
//! Starknet defines three node types for a tree.
//!
//! `Leaf nodes` which represent an actual value stored.
//!
//! `Edge nodes` which connect two nodes, and __must be__ a maximal subtree
//! (i.e. be as long as possible). This latter condition is important as it
//! strictly defines a tree (i.e. all trees with the same leaves must have the
//! same nodes). The path of an edge node can therefore be many bits long.
//!
//! `Binary nodes` is a branch node with two children, left and right. This
//! represents only a single bit on the path to a leaf.
//!
//! A tree storing a single key-value would consist of two nodes. The root node
//! would be an edge node with a path equal to the key. This edge node is
//! connected to a leaf node storing the value.
//!
//! #### Implementation details
//!
//! We've defined an additional node type, an `Unresolved node`. This is used to
//! represent a node who's hash is known, but has not yet been retrieved from
//! storage (and we therefore have no further details about it).
//!
//! Our implementation is a mix of nodes from persistent storage and any
//! mutations are kept in-memory. It is done this way to allow many mutations to
//! a tree before committing only the final result to storage. This
//! may be confusing since we just said trees are immutable -- but since we are
//! only changing the in-memory tree, the immutable tree still exists in
//! storage. One can therefore think of the in-memory tree as containing
//! the state changes between tree `N` and `N + 1`.
//!
//! The in-memory tree is built using a graph of `Rc<RefCell<Node>>` which is a
//! bit painful.
