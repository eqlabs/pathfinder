//! Blockchain history pruning is a feature that can be enabled to limit the
//! number of blocks stored in the database, thus keeping the size of the
//! database in check. The latest block is always stored.
//!
//! Database tables that are subject to pruning are:
//! - `transactions`
//! - `transaction_hashes`
//! - `block_headers`
//! - `canonical_blocks`
//! - `block_signatures`
//! - `contract_updates` (a row can be pruned if there is another row with the
//!   same `contract_address` and a higher `block_number`)
//! - `nonce_updates` (a row can be pruned if there is another row with the same
//!   `contract_address_id` and a higher `block_number`)
//! - `storage_updates` (a row can be pruned if there is another row with the
//!   same `contract_address_id`, same `storage_address_id` and a higher
//!   `block_number`)
//!
//! It is forbidden to enable pruning on a database that was created with it
//! disabled (and vice versa). However, it is possible to change the number of
//! blocks that are kept in the database between runs.
