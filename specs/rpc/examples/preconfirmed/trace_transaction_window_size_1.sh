# starknet_traceTransaction for a tx in a depth-1 pre_confirmed window.
#
# When the pre_confirmed tip is the immediate child of the committed head
# (tip == committed + 1), a tx in the tip is executed LOCALLY: its block is
# committed + 1, whose parent state is the committed head in the DB. This is the
# only case trace_transaction runs locally; anything deeper falls back to the
# gateway.
#
# The window depth isn't controllable, so we poll until the tip is committed + 1
# and has at least one tx, then trace that tx. Best-effort: state may shift
# between the check and the trace call.
