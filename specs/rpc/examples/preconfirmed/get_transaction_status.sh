# starknet_getTransactionStatus for a pre_confirmed transaction.

# The method has no block_id, but it looks up the transaction in the
# pre_confirmed window first, then the DB, and reports PRE_CONFIRMED for a tx
# that's only in the pre_confirmed block. We take the last transaction hash from
# the current pre_confirmed block and query its status.
#
# Best-effort: by query time the tx may already be committed (then the status is
# ACCEPTED_ON_L2 instead of PRE_CONFIRMED). The pre_confirmed lookup path is what
# we exercise.
