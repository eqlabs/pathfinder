# starknet_traceBlockTransactions against the pre_confirmed block, deep-window
# case.
#
# Here the pre_confirmed tip sits >= 2 blocks above the committed head, so there
# is a multi-block un-committed window below it. The executor can't read the
# tip's parent from the DB (it isn't committed), so it traces the tip on the
# committed state plus the composed parents overlay (the window fill). This is
# the path the trace_block_transactions overlay fix added.
#
# The window depth isn't controllable, so we poll until the tip leads the
# committed head by >= 2 and then trace. Best-effort: the depth may change
# between the check and the trace call.

# Override with RPC=<url> to target a different node.
