# starknet_traceBlockTransactions against the pre_confirmed block, depth-1 case.
#
# Here the pre_confirmed tip is the immediate child of the committed head
# (tip == committed + 1). The executor's base state is the committed head, which
# is already in the DB, so no parents overlay is needed: this is plain local
# execution of the tip's transactions.
#
# The window depth isn't controllable, so we poll until the tip is committed + 1
# and then trace. Best-effort: the tip may advance between the check and the
# trace call.

# Override with RPC=<url> to target a different node.
