# starknet_getTransactionByBlockIdAndIndex against the pre_confirmed block.

# Returns the transaction at a given index in the pre_confirmed block, read from
# the pre_confirmed cache. The pre_confirmed block can be empty, so we first ask
# pathfinder for its transaction count and query the last index (count - 1) when
# there is at least one transaction.
#
# Best-effort: the block keeps growing, so by the time the index query runs more
# transactions may have arrived and count-1 is no longer the actual last one.
# That's fine, the index is still valid.
