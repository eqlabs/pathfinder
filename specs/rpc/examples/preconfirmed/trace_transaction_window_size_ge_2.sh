# starknet_traceTransaction for a tx in the tip of a deep pre_confirmed window.
#
# When the pre_confirmed tip is >= 2 blocks above the committed head, a tx in the
# tip is traced locally on the committed state plus the composed diffs of the
# parents below it, covering (committed, tip - 1]. This is the deep-window overlay
# path. The gateway is not used (its trace endpoint is deprecated).
#
# The window depth isn't controllable, so we poll until the tip leads the
# committed head by >= 2 and has at least one tx, then trace that tx.
# Best-effort: state may shift between the check and the trace call.

# Override with RPC=<url> to target a different node.
